Leaflet Examples
====
Here are some exmples on how to make some sweet maps in [leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) and [d3](http://d3js.org)

Lets start from scratch
```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
   </head>
    <body>
    </body>
</html>
```
really can't get any more basic then this, but we're going to need to add just a bit more boiler plate here
```diff
<!doctype html>
-<html>
+<html lang="en">
  <head>
+    <meta charset='utf-8'/>
   </head>
    <body>
    </body>
</html>
```
